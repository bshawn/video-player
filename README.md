# video-player

## Introduction

My goal for this effort was two-fold.  1) Learn new stuff.  2) Create a video player that I could plug into the rear seat A/V
system in my wife's minivan to simplify the task of loading a movie for the kids to watch.  I wanted her to be able to control
movie selection and playback for the kids in the back seat.  As an additional option, we would be able to use the web playback
client on tablet devices (for my car with no rear entertainment option) using Socket.io to synchronize playback to multiple
screens, so each child would have their own monitor to watch.

## Goals

I created this as a learning tool for the following technologies:

- Raspberry Pi
- Node.js
- Socket.io
- Web-based video playback

## Applications

- Node.js-based player app for Raspberry Pi device
- Node.js web server for Raspberry Pi
- Web client to remote-control all connected players, simultaneously
- Web player

## Running the app

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Cross your fingers!
